# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between the type of cities (urban, suburban, and rural) and the number of riders, drivers, and total fare. We create summary statistics for each city type as well as some bubble charts and boxplots. Through the visual displays, we can see how types of cities affect the number of riders, drivers, and fares as well as proportions of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city, ultimately improving access to ride-sharing and determining affordability for underserved communities. 

## Results

Below is a table showing how total rides, total drivers, and total fares vary by type of city. In all three cases, the rural cities had the fewest numbers, while the urban cities had the greatest numbers. The average fare per driver and ride in rural cities is the highest, about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, and this is due to the small number of drivers. On the other hand, the average fare per rider and driver is lowest in urban areas because we have more drivers.

We can also see from the image below that the total fare varies by month. In the 3 types of cities, the total fare has high peeks between February and march and this can be due to many reasons, weather, holidays, etc.

## Summary 

Based on the results, it is recommended to make ride-sharing in rural cities more affordable so that people can use this service more and this is by increasing the number of drivers in those cities. 

When you increase the number of drivers, it is important to encourage more rural and suburban residents to choose ride-sharing so you don’t have a surplus of drivers. Therefore, you find the right marketing campaign, such as fuel-efficient vehicles or “gas savings” for riders.

Lastly, if we incorporated how the number of rides varies during each day into this analysis, we would increase the number of drivers at certain times like morning and evening rush hours, inclement weather, and major events.
